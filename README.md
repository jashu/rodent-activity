Rodent Activity Analyzer
======================
Python and R packages to extract and analyze data from open-field and light-dark experiments conducted with [Activity Monitor](http://www.med-associates.com/product/activity-monitor/), a system for tracking rodent locomotion and rearing using a 3D grid of infrared beams.
--------------------------------------------

The repository contains two subdirectories:

- [Activity_Translator](Activity_Translator): Written with extensive help from [Sergio Furgeson](https://github.com/EliMor/), this Python package is useful for unpacking the files exported by the [Activity Monitor](http://www.med-associates.com/product/activity-monitor/) software. It generates a single time-series file with X,Y,Z spatial coordinates for each rat and each session. This directory-file structure is used by the R package [rodact](rodact) for further analysis.

- [rodact](rodact): R package for use with output generated by [Activity Translator] lickometer](Activity_Translator). 

To install [rodact](rodact) in R type:

    library(devtools)
    install_github("rodent-activity", "jashu", subdir="rodact")
